                Transforming organizations, whether by taking a private company public or
                                                      through strategic initiatives, requires well developed project and
                                                      organization management capabilities combined with the right network
                                                      connections to accelerate value capture, by quickly identifying
                                                      opportunities and matching them with the necessary resources or partners.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, consider the transformation of a private to a public company.
                                                      The company will be subject to greater scrutiny and regulatory reporting
                                                      requirements which will require substantial effort to maintain. We can
                                                      support our clients in this transition by assessing the sufficiency of:
                                                      (1) accounting and reporting policies, processes and accounting systems; (2) finance and tax staff; (3) financial statements and
                                                      disclosures; and (4) internal control environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another transformation example to consider is the spinning off a strategic
                                                      business unit to create a new operating subsidiary. In a situation like
                                                      this there are numerous challenges faced by management, such as
                                                      conflicting stakeholder interests, employee anxiety, regulatory
                                                      compliance, and maximizing the impact to shareholders’ value.
