            <h4>Debtor</h4>
            <p>Restructurings are time critical situations each with unique challenges, complicated by the diversity of stakeholder groups, particularly in cross-border situations or those involving public companies and/or government institutions.  These situations can be further pressurized by cash constraints, working capital erosion and security restrictions.</p>
