                <p>We are Partners in Development, helping entrepreneurs and business leaders realize their corporate actions and transactions. We help you take your actions from vision/concept through, planning, outreach, negotiation, execution and implementation. To this we bring deep transactional experience, technical expertise and a strategic mindset. This is applied in the context of an extensive business network which gives us a strong foundation to assess underlying risks, counterparty exposures, and competitive environment responses among others.</p>
                <p>When we begin working with a client we visualize it through to completion, map out the networks and power relationships of the key counter parties and competitors, and consider the likelihood of various outcomes/scenarios. This allows us to devise tactics and processes accordingly and enables us to tackle even the most complex corporate action. This approach requires that our due diligence process includes that we build a clear understanding of the client's business strategy and market position - and buy into it. We believe very strongly in this approach. No corporate action can be successful if there are critical flaws in the underlying strategy.</p>
                <p>We have managed everything from assisting entrepreneurs' transition from owner-operator to IPO ready organizations through to billion dollar fund raising for green field infrastructure projects and debt restructurings. We are skilled at managing complex cross border debt restructurings with diverse stake holder interests and complications.</p>
